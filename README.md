I have done several different projects since starting with SQL. The first database program I have used was SQLite followed by recently BigQuery.
I have included all queries I have used since the beginning of my data analyst journey. I began with Khan Academy, followed by SQL Quickstart Guide (stunes), 
Covid Data, Nashville Housing Data, and most recent data from all my BigQuery Projects. 
I have all queries organized from beginning to end, seperated my an extreme extended underscore.
All queries have been created with information I have learned through the quickstart guide, google search, and my coursera program.

Thank you for looking into my work. IF you have any questions please send me a message.
Have a wonderful day!
